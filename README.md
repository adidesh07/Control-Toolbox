# Control Toolbox
This is a tool-box GUI made using Tkinter package in python meant for visualising and analysing control systems.

User can get time and frequency response plots and get transfer function properties by giving the coefficients of the transfer function as inputs.
Control, and matplotlib modules are used for analysis and plotting. PIL library used to handle images.

Icons used from www.flaticon.com 

## Home Screen
The user can select from the three options:
 1. View Transfer Function
 2. Make Plots
 3. Transfer Function Properties

## Plots Screen
By giving space separeted coefficients of numerator and denominator of the transfer function, user can get the time and frequency response plots of the system.

## Transfer Function Properties
By giving space separeted coefficients of numerator and denominator of the transfer function, user can get the following for the transfer fucntion:   
 1. Minimum transfer function
 2. DC Gain
 3. Poles
 4. Zeros
